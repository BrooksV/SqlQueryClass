SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell Module helps in creating and running WPF GUI based PowerShell Applications

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Collections of XAML & WPF Helper Functions to simplify creation of GUI WPF based PowerShell Applications 

    The main cmdlet provided by this module is New-XamlWindow, which allows you to create and configure a 
    WPF Form object from XAML String, File, or XmlDocument.

    A PowerShell WPF Application consists of the following:

    1. XAML file that defines the GUI layout and elements. This can be created manually using any text editor or via WPF editors such as Visual Studio's Blend application
    2. PowerShell Code-Behind script that initializes the application and includes the logic for handling the interactions with the GUI interface 

EXAMPLES
    See examples such as: .\tests\Test-Usage-01.ps1

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If you encounter issues while using the GuiMyPS module, try following the test examples and verify the required assemblies are loaded 
    and the New-XamlWindow CmdLet is returning a valid Form Object that can be shown using .ShowDialog() method.
    
    Also, try Killing the PowerShell session and running again.
